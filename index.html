        <h2>The Poet’s Corner</h2>
        <p><span>Blank pages</span>        

            Started off looking at the empty expanse of the white page
            the unlimited limits it bade for my imaginative mind, alas,
            one's own imagination is only as willing as one's field of thinking
            wanting to say things to quell this constant banging on my head
            yet things seem to lack when faced with the horror of the blank page
            do i dive into the expanse of love and how it's been bad το με,
            or better yet, how i've been bad to it?
            not even a single letter seems to come to mind
            do i dive into what life has to offer and what i wish i had to offer it in return?
            nothing; as though apollo himself had picked me out
            in hopes of killing whatever form of poetry a measly mortal like me could conjure up
            nothing would help but, nothing could possibly stop what the mind has to give, expect death
            so, for as long as i draw breath, against the blank pages
            do i constantly wage war in hopes to win each endless repeating battle against its might and force.
